# mbta_exit_stations
A tool to tell you what car and door to be at for optimal MBTA timing

Disclaimer: This is not currently usable in any actually useful way. But it does work, in that if the last line is:
end_exit_to_car_and_door(direction='in', end_station='South', end_exit='Silver')
the output is:
At South, to get out at Silver, be at the 3rd car from the front, front door.
